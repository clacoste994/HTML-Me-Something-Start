            <h2>Greetings</h2>
            <p>If you've found your way to this site, you're probably already aware of who I am. The worlds upmost
               expert
               on threats both real and more so imagined.
               And the threat that looms most dangerously over our heads is that of the zombie. Sure, no such thing has
               happened before, but all it takes is one
               zombie outreak for the world as we know it to end in an apocolypse. Believe me comrade, you want to ready
               when, not if this happens. Lucky for you, theres nobody with
               nearly as much knowledge on these monsters. Not only have I watched movies, like Shawn of The Dead, Warm
               Bodies, and I am Legend, I've ready
               World War Z <b>two times!!!</b> </p>

            <h2>Types of Zombies</h2>
            <ol>
               <li>
                  <h4>Classic</h4>
                  <img class="creepY" src="images/classic-zombie.jpg" alt="spooky zombie!" width="150" height="200">
                  <p id="testP" class="funParagraph">Some people make the mistake of considering these zombies a walk in
                     the part. Get it? Its because they
                     can't run and only shamble around. Don't let your guard down
                     too though. You can find yourself surround my hundreds of these decomposing fleshbags before you
                     know
                     it.
                  </p>

                  <p id="testP" class="funParagraph">Now these andrenaline pumped freaks are not your grandma's zombies.
                     The run, they climb, and they
                     won't stop until they'll ripped your throat out! Dob't expect to come out
                     unscathed after an encounter with these monsters. Even the prepared will have a hard time seeing
                     the
                     next day while fighting these everyday.

            <h2>You and The Zombie</h2>
            <img src="images/human.webp" alt="Brrr" width="200" height="200">
            <p>Some would say the most dangerous aspect of the zombie threat is the zombie's former humanity. I tend to
               view that thinking as hogwash. <b>They are dead and we are living!</b>
               Even if the zombie facing me was a family member when they were living, I'd blast them away without a
               second
               thought! Thinking and wasting
               time with empathy will lead you on the fast track to getting devoured!</p>

            <h2>Avoid The Zombie</h2>
            <ol>
               <li>
                  <h4>Going North</h4>
                  <img src="images/frozen.jpg" alt="Brrr" width="250" height="200">
                  <p>This is one of the more popular idea. Zombies lack body heat, so they will simply freeze in the
                     cold.
                     Thats simple, but the cold isn't very
                     forgiving to humans either. There will be so many people heading up north that they will lack both
                     the
                     resources and infrastructure to
                     shelter all the refugees.
                  </p>
               </li>
               <li>
                  <h4>Going South</h4>
                  <img src="images/peace.jpg" alt="nice" width="250" height="200">
                  <p>This is obviously the preferred option. Yes, zombies can survive in the heat, but for how long? The
                     heat will decompase they fast and they
                     shouldn't be a threat past a season or two. There's also the add plus that most people will head
                     north, leaving more resources for the
                     wise few that go south into the heat.
